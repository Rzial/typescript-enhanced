Typescript Enhanced
===================

[Typescript Enhanced](https://github.com/Rzial/typescript-enhanced) is an
extension of the existing Typescript package that modifies the functionality of
the `tsc` command giving it some superpowers.

This package aims for the following guidelines:
* Minimal external dependency
* Minimal modifications on the original Typescript package
* Minimal workflow changes 
* Maximal clarity of code

Other solutions that do the same task as Typescript Enhanced don't follow
anything similar to this making hard knowing what happens under the hood. In
this package you will be able to understand what is happening on the
enhancements just by reading their source files.
